        <p>
          I’m Matteo a  student born and raised in New York,
          with a passion for bringing ideas to life across many different mediums.
          Whether I’m painting, editing videos in After Effects, or drawing on 
          Procreate, I love exploring ways to turn digital visuals into stories.
          I attend Fiorello H. LaGuardia High School where I’ve taken a multitude of art courses, 
          including digital media, ceramics, printmaking, and 3D mixed media. 
          Over the years, I’ve grown comfortable using tools like Illustrator, Final Cut Pro, and Photoshop to 
          manage projects and express myself. I also enjoy building online communities and have successfully run several social media pages
          since I was young.

         Outside of school, I stay creative through gaming, swimming, writing, and traveling. 
          These experiences often inspire my artwork and give me new perspectives 
          to explore in my projects. From 2020 to 2021, I ran a commissions business
          where I completed over 30 paid digital art and video editing commissions,
          some for creators with large platforms. I even made online tutorials to help
          new artists. My interests in tech, design, and communication have made me 
          confident with both digital and traditional art, and I’m always looking for 
          new ways to grow. Whether it’s through drawing, storytelling,
          or just connecting with others online, I’m constantly creating.
